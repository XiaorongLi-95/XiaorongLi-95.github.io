**Research:** My research interests include continual learning, online learning and image recognition, etc.

**Biography:** I got my Ph.D. degree in the school of mathematics and statistics of [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Zongben Xu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zbxucn) and co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Sun](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/jiansun). I received the Bachelor degree in school of science from [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn), China, in 2018.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
